Caseplans - Makerbox SVGs for the SpaceApi box
==============================================

The following files were used with OSAA PhotonSaw to create the SpaceApi box:
We had to split the original file, to fit the two pieces of acrylic that we had sponsored from Bertho.
Also I dropped the front after the first cut, and a corner broke off. 
We tested some better matching holes on the new front, to mount the LEDs without hot-glue.
